    <p>"Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide," Stephen Zawistowski, science adviser for the <br />
     American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Business Insider. "And a box gives them a place of <br />safety and security."</p>
    <p>While inside a box, cats feel that they cannot be snuck up on from behind or the side — anything that wants to approach them 
      <br />must come directly into their field of vision. In effect, such hiding spaces allow them to watch the world around them without being seen.</p>
